The Stream branch of VBIT-Pi removes the hardware driving part of VBIT-Pi. It creates a stream of data that can be used by separate process to drive a teletext inserter. In this case, the intended inserter is Alistair Buxton's raspi-teletext which uses the video output of a Raspberry Pi to generate teletext without any additional hardware. The complete installation sets up a Raspberry Pi with VBIT-Pi driving Raspi-Teletext with a small selection of pages. The installation instructions TeletextDIY.sla can be found at http://www teastop.co.uk/teletext/vbit
